In accordance to guidelines from the Governor and the CDC, our dining room is closed until further notice. We remain open for business and continue to accept phone-in and walk-in orders for take-out only. To properly observe social distancing, we may limit the number of customers allowed at the order counter and request you wait outside for your order.

We appreciate your support and continued business.

Best regards,
